PROBLEM STATEMENT:
==================
Provided a training corpus corpus.txt. Use it to create an n-gram language model, where n can be provided as a parameter. Perform smoothing on the language model using:
+ Witten Bell Smoothing, and
+ Kneyser Ney Smoothing
  
### HOW TO RUN :
```python
			python3 language_model.py <value of n> <smoothing type> <path to input corpus>
```
+ where n can be between 1 and 3, and smoothing type can be k for Kneyser Ney or w for Witten Bell.

### Implementation:
